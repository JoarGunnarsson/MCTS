# Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for a simple Card Game AI

## Overview

This Python project implements the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to create an intelligent AI for a simple card game. The MCTS algorithm is widely used in artificial intelligence for decision-making in various domains, and this project demonstrates its application in a card game setting.

## Introduction

The project focuses on developing an AI player for a simple card game using the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm. The primary goal is to explore the effectiveness of MCTS in decision-making scenarios, particularly in the context of card games, where other algorithms, such as MinMax can be hard to implement.

## Dependencies

To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Numpy
- Unix operating system

## Usage

Run cardgame.py in the Unix terminal to start the cardgame. Avoid using the arrow keys, instead navigate the menus using WASD keys.
